# 🚀 My Java Learning Journey  

Hi! 👋 I'm currently learning **Java** and documenting my progress in this repository. This repository contains my practice code, notes, and small projects as I explore Java programming.  

## 📌 **Current Learning Topics**  
✔ Java Basics (Syntax, Variables, Data Types)  
✔ Control Statements (If-Else, Loops, Switch)  
✔ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
✔ Exception Handling  
✔ Collections & Data Structures  

## 🎯 **My Goals**  
- Understand core Java concepts  
- Build small Java projects  
- Practice coding challenges  
- Learn about Java frameworks (Spring Boot in the future)  

## 🔧 **Setup & Run Java Programs**  
1. Install JDK ([Download Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html))  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-learning.git
   cd java-learning

3. Compile and run Java programs:

javac MyProgram.java
java MyProgram



📚 Resources I'm Using:

[Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)

[W3Schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

## ⚠️ Important Note for Cloning or Running Files

In Java, the filename **must match** the public class name inside the file.  
This project follows a pattern like:

```bash
Filename: 48_Handling_Specific_Exceptions.java
Class:   public class Handling_Specific_Exceptions
```
However, due to renaming files with serial numbers for learning order, some files may show a mismatch between the filename and the public class name.

### 🛠 How to Fix the Error:
If you get an error like:
```
Error: Main method not found in class ...
```

### Follow these steps:
1. Open the file causing the error.
2. Rename the class to match the filename (excluding .java), or rename the file to match the class.
-Example:
  -If file name is 48_Handling_Specific_Exceptions.java, then class name should be:
   ```
   
   public class 48_Handling_Specific_Exceptions // ❌ Invalid (cannot start with number)
   public class Handling_Specific_Exceptions    // ✅ Correct (rename file instead)
   ```
   
3. ✅ Recommended: Rename the file to match the class name instead of modifying the code.
-So 48_Handling_Specific_Exceptions.java → Handling_Specific_Exceptions.java
#### 💡 Tip: You can run files easily using any IDE like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or online compilers. Just make sure file name and class name match.
